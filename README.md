## About

**verbMASCHINE** is a long, looming reverb, coupled with a fuzzy op amp distortion. The reverb is based off of the *BDTR-3 Belton Brick* while the distortion is mimicking the clipping character of a *TLC27M4AIN* op amp. 

**verbMASCHINE** is inspired by the Death By Audio [Reverberation Machine](https://deathbyaudio.com/products/reverberation-machine) but is in no way a hardware clone or emulation.
